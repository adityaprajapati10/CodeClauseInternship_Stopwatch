# Timer and Stopwatch

This repository contains two implementations of a Timer and Stopwatch application in Java: a console-based version and a Java Swing-based graphical user interface (GUI) version.

## Console-Based Timer and Stopwatch

The console-based version of the Timer and Stopwatch allows users to interact with the application through text commands. You can start, stop, reset, and exit the Timer and Stopwatch using simple text commands. This implementation provides accurate timing and is suitable for command-line enthusiasts.

## Java Swing-Based Timer and Stopwatch

The Java Swing-based version of the Timer and Stopwatch offers a graphical user interface for a more user-friendly experience. You can start, stop, and reset the Timer and Stopwatch with the click of a button. This implementation features real-time updates and a visually appealing display of time.

## How to Use

### Console-Based Version

1. Open a command-line terminal.
2. Compile and run the `ConsoleStopwatch.java` file.
3. Follow the on-screen instructions to control the Timer and Stopwatch.

### Java Swing-Based Version

1. Compile and run the `Stopwatch.java` file.
2. The GUI application will appear, allowing you to control the Timer and Stopwatch with buttons.

Feel free to explore both versions of the Timer and Stopwatch and choose the one that best suits your preferences.

Enjoy experimenting with timekeeping and measurement using this Java project!
